# Unit 18 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

## Description

See a short description of my project below.

For this assignment I set up the back end of a fitness tracker. When using this app you will be able to add exercises to the most recent workout plan, add new exercises to a new workout plan, view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page, and view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.

## Installation Instructions

Run the following commands in terminal to see the application in localhost:3000

npm i, npm run seed, npm start
